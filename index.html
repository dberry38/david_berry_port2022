                <h2>Welcome To My Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I am happy and excited to be on my way toward a new career in web development! I know very little at this point; a bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. I am determined to become the best dev I can be!<br><br> Be sure to check in every once in a while for updates and possibly entirely new editions to my portfolio.

<!-- Didn't have time to figure this out, but the footer is displaying in the middle of the page instead of the bottom. I didn't want to set its position to fixed. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the line-height declared for body in css, but can't change that without messing up the whole thing. -->

            Made with love. And code. Mostly code.
